			<h2>Schooling</h2>
			<p>I have primarily focused on computer software in my schooling, 
			with two (soon to be three) web design/html/css classes under my belt,
			a python class in the works, a java class, a javascript class, and 
			Computer Science A in high school. I am actively looking to broaden 
			my horizons in this field. I also have some skill in graphic design.</p>
			<p class="reference">I attended <a href="https://bvsw.bluevalleyk12.org">Blue Valley Southwest</a> in highschool 
			and am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.jccc.edu">JCCC</a>, although I am <strong>technically</strong> 
			still a student at Southwest.</p>
