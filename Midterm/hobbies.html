			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I enjoy writing, several creative arts, and music. I can play the flute and the 
			cello. I have not written anything longer than a short story so far, but that is a 
			work in progress. I also enjoy creating jewelry, although I currently lack the tools, 
			creating ceramics (I decided on a whim to start a collection of ceramic kirby 
			paraphernalia in high school), and sometimes drawing. I also learned the absolute 
			basics of knitting before dropping it.</p>
			<p>To summarize the list of things I've tried my hand at:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Writing</li>
				<li>Music</li>
				<li>Jewelry</li>
				<li>Ceramics</li>
				<li>Graphic Design</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Nonprofessional Skills</h2>
			<p>I have a black belt in taekwondo. It took a while to get it because I kept bouncing 
			around various schools, but I did. The first school I went to shut down during the COVID-19 
			pandemic, and got bought out by another one, which I transferred to and got my actual belt at, 
			but the new one sucked so I went to a third school that turned out to be related, which was way 
			better.</p>
